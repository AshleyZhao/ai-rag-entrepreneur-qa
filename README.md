# ðŸ¤– OpenAI chatbot for Q&A with entrepreneurs

This online chatbot can answer questions from the perspectives of established entrepreneurs, in the format of "What does Elon Musk think about AI?". The answers are based on transcripts of interviews with the subject. The application uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pattern running in Azure, using Azure AI Search for retrieval and OpenAI large language models.
